/**
 * tree traversal (applicable to all trees)
 * problem: how to visit every node of a tree once
 * two approaches:
 * * breadth-first search visits every node by following along the siblings of each layer of the tree
 *   ie. going across the tree
 * * depth-first search visits every node by following along each branch of the tree (from left to right)
 *   ie. going to the leafs of the tree and then going back up
 *   * InOrder
 *   * PreOrder
 *   * PostOrder
